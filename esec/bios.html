			<p class="bio-subtitle"> Doing More with Less: Human Flight on the Power of a Cordless Drill </p>
			<p class="bio-subtitle"> Biography </p>
			<p class="bio-content"> Having been likened to modern day Wright Brothers, Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson are known for the achievement of two historical aviation firsts. In 2010, Todd and Cameron led a team of engineering students to the realization of an ancient aeronautical dream with the first sustained flight of a human-powered flapping-wing aircraft. For this achievement Todd and Cameron were named co-recipients of the CASI Trans-Canada McKee Trophy, among the highest honours in Canadian Aerospace. As a follow on to their first success, the two sought to tackle the 33-year old AHS Sikorsky Prize: a challenge requiring a human-powered helicopter to reach an altitude of 3 metres and stay aloft for 60 seconds. On June 13th 2013, they achieved what many had thought to be impossible, with the prize-winning flight of the Atlas helicopter. </p> 
			<p class="bio-content"> Cameron and Todd met during their studies at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, Cameron earning his MASc in 2010 and Todd his PhD in 2011. In 2012, they started AeroVelo Inc., a company dedicated to increasing the public's awareness of sustainable solutions to society's most pressing technological challenges. AeroVelo has focused on using human-powered vehicles as a teaching platform to demonstrate innovative and creative engineering and to challenge the general perception of the impossible. </p>
 			<p class="bio-subtitle"> Abstract </p>
			<p class="bio-content">  On June 13th, 2013, AeroVelo’s Atlas Human-Powered Helicopter captured the 33-year-outstanding AHS Sikorsky Prize. Todd and Cameron will describe the path leading to this historic achievement, and the process behind the creation of Atlas. This will include the Snowbird Human-Powered Ornithopter, which in 2010 became the first successful human-powered flapping wing aircraft. The evolving aircraft design technologies involved in developing these unique vehicles have included Multi-Disciplinary Optimization, high-performance composite structures, as well as many creative and innovative solutions to engineering challenges. Todd and Cameron will also discuss future human-powered projects, including their current focus on high-speed human-powered land vehicles and the quest for the World human-powered land speed record. </p>

			<p class="bio-subtitle"> Abstract </p>
			<p class="bio-content">  Micro- and nanoscale technologies are emerging as powerful tools for controlling the interaction between cells and their surroundings for biological studies, tissue engineering, and cell-based screening. In addition, hydrogel biomaterials have been increasingly used in various tissue engineering applications since they provide cells with a hydrated 3D microenvironment that mimics the native extracellular matrix. In our lab we have developed various approaches to merge microscale techniques with hydrogel biomaterials for directing stem cell differentiation and generating complex 3D tissues. In this talk, I will outline our work in controlling the cell-microenvironment interactions by using patterned hydrogels to direct the differentiation of stem cells. In addition, I will describe the fabrication and the use of microscale hydrogels for tissue engineering by using a ‘bottom-up’ and a ‘top-down’ approach. Top-down approaches for fabricating complex engineered tissues involve the use of miniaturization techniques to control cell-cell interactions or to recreate biomimetic microvascular networks. Our group has also pioneered bottom-up approaches to generate tissues by the assembly of shape-controlled cell-laden microgels (i.e. tissue building blocks), that resemble functional tissue units. In this approach, microgels were fabricated and induced to self assemble to generate 3D tissue structures with controlled microarchitecture and cell-cell interactions. </p>

			<p class="bio-subtitle"> Abstract </p>
			<p class="bio-content"> The extent to which people walk or ride a bike has changed significantly over the last century.  The introduction of the automobile, among other things, resulted in significant shifts in mode choice for many people.  While engineers have always been present to provide the infrastructure needed to accommodate all road users, for many years, preference was given to the automobile.  Now, increasing expectations for walkable communities have “fast-forwarded” society into what we had at the turn of the last century – in other words, we’ve come full circle to walking and cycling.  The difference is that now engineers are expected to better accommodate all users of the system, and not just automobiles.  This presentation takes a look at the history of mobility from the walking and cycling perspectives, and addresses the role that engineering has played and continues to play in the provision of infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists. </p>

		<p class="bio-subtitle"> Biography </p>
		<p class="bio-content">  David is the co-founder, Chief Technology Officer, and Senior Vice President of Commercialization at Ambri Inc., a start-up company spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is commercializing a new battery technology for grid-scale stationary storage applications. In 2010, he received the prestigious TR35 award from Technology Review, rating him as one of the world’s top 35 innovators under 35 for co-inventing Ambri's liquid metal battery as a graduate student at MIT. </p> 
		<p class="bio-content"> David leads the technical team at Ambri to develop the liquid metal battery technology, with a determined focus on creating a low cost and effective storage technology to meet the strenuous performance and cost requirements for large-scale stationary energy storage applications. The project has raised more than $25M in funding, including a prestigious ARPAe grant from the US Department of Energy, and two round of venture financing for Ambri Inc. from Bill Gates, Total SA, and Khosla Ventures. </p>
		<p class="bio-content">David earned a BSc in Engineering Physics from Queen's University, and an MEng and a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </p>
		<p class="bio-subtitle"> Abstract </p>
		<p class="bio-content">  The electricity power grid is undergoing significant changes. In North America, the base-load nuclear generating fleet is approaching retirement, transmission lines are aging, the price of natural gas has plummeted, and installing new electric power infrastructure faces permitting and siting challenges. Moreover, broad-scale penetration of renewable resources, like wind and solar, are straining the grid and hindering further deployment in some locations. One approach to address these challenges is low-cost, long lifespan stationary energy storage, and Ambri is developing a new battery that can change the way electric grids are operated worldwide. Ambri’s technology — the liquid metal battery — was invented in the labs of Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Dr. David Bradwell (BSc Eng Phys, Queen’s U. 2005), and Professor Donald R. Sadoway (PhD UofT, 1977, Time 100 Most Influential People: 2012). In 2010, Bradwell and Sadoway co-founded Ambri to commercialize the technology. Ambri is presently staffed with 40 outstanding staff, and is on route to deploying its first commercial prototype systems in 2014. </p>
