          <h1> Motivation </h2>
          <h5> October 15th, 2014 </h5>
          <p> About a month ago my brother asked me how I stay motivated to do extra-curriculars and projects outside of school and I gave him a quick answer about signing up for things which affect other people, but I wasn't entirely satisfied with my answer. I decided that sharing my thoughts on it could hopefully be beneficial for someone. </p>
          <h2> Me and Extra-Curriculars </h2>
          <p> I've always had a very tight history with extra-curriculars. When I was extremely young my parents signed me up for activities and this naturally transitioned to me doing a little of everything in high school. </p>
          <p> I participated in school plays, student council, sport teams and general interest clubs. Whenever an opportunity presented itself I just said "sure". Motivation never seemed to play much of a role as they were all fun. </p>
          <h3> Transitioning to University Life</h3>
          <p> However once I started university a few things changed. First and foremost being that my life is a lot less structured and you don't have the same routines and organization which provided me with convenient opportunities for projects and extra-curriculars. </p>
          <p> I actually had a considerable amount of school work to keep up with (yay EngSci), which both drains energy and makes me wary of committing to other projects. </p>
          <p> Projects and extra-curriculars oftentimes involve more effort and time now. As usually you're working on bigger and more exciting things and need to do more than just show-up for an hour or two. </p>
          <h2> Overcoming These Concerns & Staying Motivated </h2>
          <h3> Make your project affect other people </h3>
          <h3> Have deadlines </h3>
          <h3> Don't battle </h3>
          <h3> Start with one thing </h3>

          <h2> Quick Notes </h2>
          <ul>
            <li> I like our judging format. 1st round are roaming judges doing casual demos / q&a with each team. They choose 10 finalists who present for everyone and a second panel of judges. From the finalists the eventual winners are chosen. </li>
            <li> We should make more of a show at the end of the event. Some incredible apps were created and we can do more to make them feel like they won an awesome event other than giving them their cash. </li>
            <li> We will consider having guest speakers / tech talks during the event. We didn’t feel the need to this year as we run other events through Hacker Academy which provide these to students. However it could potentially add to the hackathon. </li>
            <li> Don’t procrastinate, especially on judges & sponsorship. All the obvious things we always want to do better at. </li>
          </ul>
